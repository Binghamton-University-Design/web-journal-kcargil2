					<h2>Project 2:
						Scalable Icons</h2>
					<p><img src="images/icons.jpg"></p>
					<p>The second project we worked on making scalable, personal icons. These icons had to come in three, pixel based sizes, 128x128px, 64x64px, 32x32px. I chose to create flat, line icons with a 5pt. stroke. I felt that this would simplify the icons enough so that when they were scaled up or down, I would not have to alter the main structure or eliminate elements too much.</p> 

					<p>My first inspiration for this assignment was Celtic knots. I take pride in my Irish heritage and wanted to incorporate a Celtic knot style into each of my designs to make them cohesive.</p>  

					<p>The first icon is a steaming, hot cup of tea. I love tea so it was an easy first choice for a personal icon. As I mentioned before, I flattened the icon instead of giving it dimension in order to simplify its shape. In order to make the design more interesting than just a flat mug, I put a sort of loop in the handle and made the steam shapes mirror this loop. As the icon got smaller, I filled the loops because the counter space was too small and removed the letter “T.”</p>

					<p>The second icon is an acorn. Acorns come from oak trees which symbolize strength, wisdom, loyalty, heritage, and honor in Celtic folklore. People tell me these are some traits that I have, but I also loved the connection to my heritage. An acorn, being the seed for an oak tree, has a sense of hope and growth which are characteristics that I try to remember daily. I used the basic form of the triquetra knot for the bottom of the acorn and repeated the steam shape to create a pattern for the acorns hat.</p>  

					<p>The third icon I had trouble making. I was originally going to work on an oak leaf to compliment the acorn, but was having trouble tying in the Celtic knot aspects. During the process, I began to repeat the shape I used for the mug handle. This repeated shape reminded of me of sunflower petals and how much I love sunshine. My mom would always sing “You are my Sunshine” to my sister and I, so I took this a sign that I had found my final icon.</p> 

					<p>After creating black and white icons, I brought in color. I decides to use muted, warm colors, and navy blue for a dark accent. I only colored the strokes and filled in the occasional loop or shape.

					<h2>Project 1: 
						Isometric Avatar</h2>
					<p><img src="images/avatar.gif"></p>
					<p>For this first project I used an isometric grid in Adobe Illustrator and made an avatar of myself. There were some key characteristics that I felt were most important to represent myself like my curly hair, cup of tea, and Converse. I did my best to accurately portray my facial features while keeping a sort of whimsical feel. The most difficult part was seeing the dimention in the isometric grid.
